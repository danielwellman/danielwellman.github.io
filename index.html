            <p>
                I am a software developer and coach who is passionate about building and helping others build great software. I’m
                a
                practitioner of Extreme Programming and Agile development methodologies, and am especially interested in
                Test Driven Development and design. Most of my language experience is with Java, Ruby, and JavaScript, along with bits of Scala and Smalltalk.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve written articles
                about the software development process for Better Software magazine and
                blogged for about a year at StickyMinds.com. My project experience has included
                products in the education, finance, consumer product reviews, job search, telecommunications, and manufacturing industries.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a brief period of my life, I worked as an audio engineer recording audio books in New York. I’m a
                music
                enthusiast and play the guitar for fun.
            </p>

            <h2>Code</h2>

            <p>
            I am the author of <a href="http://github.com/danielwellman/bane">Bane</a>, a test harness used to test your application's interaction with other servers. It is based upon the material from Michael Nygard's "Release It!" book as described in the "Test Harness" chapter.

            <h2>Speaking</h2>

            <p>
                I speak to teams about software development issues with an emphasis on the technical practices and
                tools.
                Some of the topics include Test-Driven Development, Refactoring, Object-Oriented Design, Mock Objects,
                GWT, and Ruby on Rails. I have given
                these talks to developers at organizations such as Charles Schwab, Kaplan, and Skarven
                Enterprises, a Boeing company.

            <h3>How to Introduce Automated Unit Tests in Legacy Apps</h3>
            <p>
                I presented this talk at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/xp-26/events/16214945/">The New York XP &amp; Agile Meetup</a>.  Here are the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/etldan/how-to-start-testdriven-development-in-legacy-code-12982341">slides</a>.

            <h3>Agile 2009 Presentation</h3>

            <p>
                I co-presented "Agile AJAX: The Google Web Toolkit Experience" at the Agile 2009 conference with Paul
                Infield-Harm. This session introduced <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> and how it
                could be used in a team following agile development practices. Attendee feedback was positive,
                with consistent scores of four or five (out of a maximum of five) on the feedback forms.
